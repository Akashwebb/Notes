# Search algorithms are used to retrieve some information stored in a data structure.

# LINEAR Search :
1. Linear Search is a very common searching algorithm; 
It is implemented under the hood in the JavaScript built-in methods indexOf(), includes(), find(), and findIndex().

2. Simply loop over each element in an array and stop if that element equals our target value, then return that element’s index. 

3. The best case time complexity of Linear Search is O(1) and Worst case is  O(n)

4. Linear Search is the best we can do when searching unsorted arrays, such as [4, 2, 3].


const linear=(arr,target)=>{
    for(let i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
        if(arr[i]===target){
            console.log(i)
        }
    }
}
linear([2,7,9,1,5,3] , 5)


# BINARY Search :

1. Binary Search can be used to search for values in SORTED arrays only – such as [1, 2, 3, 6, 9]. 

2. Binary Search is a “divide and conquer” type algorithm; it divides the array roughly in half every time it checks whether a value is the one we’re looking for.

3. Best complexity : O(1)    and    Worst complexity : O(logn)
