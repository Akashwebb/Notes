OOPS is Object-Oriented Programming.  It is an approach to developing software programming. 

1. It was introduced to overcome flaws in the procedural approach to programmings such as 
   Reusability and Maintainability and Security 
Object-oriented programming or OOPS is a methodology of designing an application using classes and objects.

2. The fundamental idea behind object-oriented language is to combine into a single unit with both data and functions.

3. The data and functions that operate on that data such as a unit are called an object.

-- A class is a blueprint from which objects are created. A class describes the state or behavior of an object.
A class can have attributes and methods:

-- An object is an instance of a class. It contains an address and takes up memory space. 
Objects have states and behavior defined as per their template definition.

# Procedural Oriented Programming  && 	Object-Oriented Programming

** In procedural programming, the program is divided into small parts called functions and follow structure or procedure	
   In object-oriented programming, the program is divided into small parts called objects.

** Procedural programming follows a top-down approach.	
   Object-oriented programming follows a bottom-up approach.

** There is no access specifier in procedural programming.	
   Object-oriented programming has access specifiers like private, public, protected, etc.

** Adding new data and functions is not easy.	EX :- C, FORTRAN, Pascal, Basic, etc.
   Adding new data and function is easy.        EX :- C++, Java, Python, C#, etc.
