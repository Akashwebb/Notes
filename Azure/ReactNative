React native uses same codebase for both Android and IOS
1. Android App Development
Languages: Java, Kotlin
IDE (Development Tool): Android Studio
UI Frameworks: Jetpack Compose, XML-based layouts
Build System: Gradle
Testing Tools: Espresso, JUnit

2. iOS App Development
Languages: Swift, Objective-C
IDE (Development Tool): Xcode
UI Frameworks: SwiftUI, UIKit
Build System: Xcode Build System
Testing Tools: XCTest

npx @react-native-community/cli@latest init AwesomeProject  ( to create an app )

<View> replaces <div>  , <Text> replaces <p> or <span>.
No HTML, only JSX components.
Styling is done using StyleSheet API instead of CSS.

SCSS : Sassy CSS , It allows variables, nesting, and mixins, making styles more reusable and maintainable.
Example:
$primary-color: blue;
.container {
  background-color: $primary-color;
  color: white;
}

FOLDER STRUCTURE : 
1. android/ (Android-specific code)
AndroidManifest.xml → Contains Android app permissions & settings.
MainActivity.java → Entry point for the Android app.
build.gradle → Configuration file for dependencies & SDK version.

2. ios/ (iOS-specific code)
Info.plist → Contains iOS app metadata (permissions, display name, etc.).
AppDelegate.m → Entry point for the iOS app.
Podfile → Manages iOS dependencies using CocoaPods.

3. index.js (Entry Point)
4. App.js (Main App Component)
5. package.json (Project Config & Dependencies)
6. babel.config.js (Babel Configuration) - Babel helps transform modern JavaScript to be compatible with older environments.
7. metro.config.js (Metro Bundler Config)

# Core React Native Components:
1. SafeAreaView → Ensures content is within the safe area (avoids notches, status bar, etc.).
2. ScrollView → Provides a scrollable container for child components.
3. StatusBar → Controls the appearance of the device’s status bar (color, visibility, etc.).
4. StyleSheet → Helps define styles in a structured manner, similar to CSS.
5. Text → Displays text content in the app.
6. useColorScheme → A React Hook that detects whether the system theme is light or dark.
7. View → A basic container for laying out UI elements (similar to <div> in HTML).
8. KeyboardAvoidingView ->	Prevents the keyboard from overlapping input fields.
9. Modal -> Displays a pop-up/modal dialog.
10.FlatList	-> Optimized for rendering large lists with better performance.
11. SectionList -> Similar to FlatList but supports grouped sections.
12. ActivityIndicator -> Displays a loading spinner.
13. Vibration -> Triggers device vibrations.
14. TouchableOpacity -> 

# React Navigation :

Steps :
npm install @react-navigation/native   ->  This is the core package ,  provides the NavigationContainer
npm install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated react-native-vector-icons  -> dependencies

1. Stack Navigator (for screen-to-screen navigation)    ->  npm install @react-navigation/stack
2. Bottom Tab Navigator (for bottom tabs)   ->  @react-navigation/bottom-tabs
3. Drawer Navigator (for side menu drawer)

#Icons : 
npm install react-native-vector-icons
1.Create a folder, asset and fonts   in android/src/main/assets/fonts
2.Search, react-native-vector-icons in   Node Module
3.Copy paste , all font files, Icons, inside assets/fonts





1. SafeAreaView is a built-in component in React Native that ensures content is displayed within the safe area boundaries of a device, avoiding overlaps with notches, status bars, and navigation bars.
--> Uses flex: 1 → Makes it take the full screen height.

import React from 'react';
import { SafeAreaView, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
const App = () => {
  return (
    <SafeAreaView style={styles.container}>
      <Text>Hello, this is inside SafeAreaView!</Text>
    </SafeAreaView>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#f0f0f0',
  },
});

export default App;
