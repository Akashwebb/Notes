Think of it as Microsoft’s big online computer that you can use for hosting apps, storing data, running code, 
and much more without managing physical servers.

4. IaaS, PaaS, SaaS (The 3 Cloud Services)   🏗️ 🏗️ 
Think of them like services in a restaurant.

*IaaS* (Infrastructure as a Service)  🍳 🍳 
Examples: Azure VM, AWS EC2
Used for: complete control over computing.

*PaaS* (Platform as a Service)  🍽️ 🍽️ 
Examples: Azure App Service, Azure Functions
Used for: hosting apps easily without managing servers.

*SaaS* (Software as a Service)  🛵 🛵 
Examples: Gmail, Office 365, Teams, Salesforce
Used when you want to use software directly.

5. Azure Storage   
Blob Storage  -> PDFs, Images, Videos
Table Storage  -> Key value pair
File Storage   -> Company shared folder 
Queue Storage  -> Background 
### A blob = a file. Blobs live inside containers, which live inside a storage account.

6. Azure Database
SQL   -> Azure Sql server 
NoSql  -> CosmoDb

| Task                            | Where it goes in Azure |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Upload file                     |  Azure Blob Storage    |
| Store file details (name, date) |  Azure SQL Database    |
| API that handles upload         |  Azure App Service     |
