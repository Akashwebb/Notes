Here are some important medium-level Azure interview questions with their answers:

1️⃣ Azure Basics & Fundamentals
Q1: What is Azure Resource Manager (ARM), and how does it work?
Answer:
Azure Resource Manager (ARM) is the deployment and management service for Azure. It allows you to create, update, and delete resources as a group instead of managing them individually.
Uses JSON-based ARM templates for infrastructure as code (IaC).
Supports role-based access control (RBAC) for security.
Enables declarative deployment without manual intervention.

Q2: What is an Azure Virtual Machine (VM), and how is it different from Azure App Services?
Answer:
Azure VM: A fully managed Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) that provides virtualized computing power. Requires manual OS and software management.
Azure App Services: A Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solution for hosting web apps, APIs, and mobile backends, without managing the underlying infrastructure.
Use Azure VMs when you need full control over the environment.
Use App Services when you want a managed hosting solution for applications.

Q3: Explain Azure Availability Zones and how they improve reliability.
Answer:
Azure Availability Zones are physically separate data centers within an Azure region. Each zone has independent power, networking, and cooling, ensuring high availability (99.99% uptime SLA) for critical workloads.
Example: Deploying VMs across multiple zones ensures failover in case of a zone failure.

Q4: What is an Azure Resource Group, and why is it important?
Answer:
An Azure Resource Group is a container that holds related Azure resources (VMs, databases, storage, etc.). It helps in:
✅ Logical organization of resources.
✅ Managing permissions using RBAC.
✅ Monitoring & cost tracking at the group level.



💡 Best Practice: Keep resources with similar lifecycles in the same group.
Q5: What is the difference between Azure Blob Storage, File Storage, and Disk Storage?
Answer:
Storage Type	Use Case	Features
Blob Storage	Storing unstructured data (images, videos, backups)	Object storage, highly scalable
File Storage	Network file sharing across Azure VMs	Supports SMB protocol, managed file shares
Disk Storage	Persistent storage for VMs	SSDs/HDDs, optimized for performance
Use Blob Storage for cloud applications, File Storage for shared access, and Disk Storage for VMs.


2️⃣ Azure Compute Services
Q6: What are the different types of Azure Virtual Machine scaling?
Answer:

Manual Scaling – Manually adjust the number of VM instances.
Autoscale – Automatically increases or decreases VM instances based on CPU/memory utilization.
Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS) – Automatically deploys and manages identical VMs across availability zones.
💡 Best Practice: Use VM Scale Sets for high availability and autoscaling.

Q7: Explain Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and its advantages.
Answer:
Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a managed Kubernetes service that automates containerized application deployment, scaling, and operations.

✅ Simplifies Kubernetes cluster management.
✅ Built-in monitoring with Azure Monitor.
✅ Auto-scaling based on demand.
✅ Integrated security with Azure Active Directory (AAD).

Use AKS when deploying microservices and containerized applications.


Q8: What is the difference between Azure Functions and Logic Apps?
Answer:

Feature	Azure Functions	Azure Logic Apps
Type	Serverless compute	Workflow automation
Trigger	Code-based (HTTP, queue, event)	Event-driven (APIs, connectors)
Use Case	Custom functions, API backend	Integrating services, workflows
💡 Use Azure Functions for event-driven backend logic, and Logic Apps for automating workflows like email notifications.

Q9: How does Azure App Service Plan work, and how do you choose the right plan?
Answer:
Azure App Service Plan determines the scalability, performance, and pricing of web applications.
🔹 Free/Tier: For testing & learning.
🔹 Basic: Small applications with low traffic.
🔹 Standard: Medium traffic applications with auto-scaling.
🔹 Premium: High-performance apps with better security & scaling.


💡 Choose a plan based on traffic, performance needs, and budget.

Q10: How do you secure an Azure VM and restrict access?
Answer:
✅ Use NSGs (Network Security Groups) to control inbound/outbound traffic.
✅ Enable Just-In-Time (JIT) access to limit VM login time.
✅ Use Azure Bastion to securely access VMs without exposing public IP.
✅ Implement disk encryption with Azure Key Vault.
✅ Enable Defender for Cloud to detect security threats.


Best Practice: Disable RDP/SSH public access and use VPN or Bastion for secure connections.

3️⃣ Azure Networking
Q11: What is an Azure Virtual Network (VNet), and how does it work?
Answer:
Azure Virtual Network (VNet) is a logically isolated network in Azure that enables secure communication between Azure services and on-premises networks.

✅ Subnets – Divide networks for better management.
✅ VPN Gateway – Connects on-premises networks to Azure.
✅ NSGs – Control traffic between resources.

💡 Best Practice: Use multiple subnets to separate workloads like databases, web servers, and application servers.

Q12: What is the purpose of Azure VPN Gateway?
Answer:
Azure VPN Gateway securely connects on-premises networks to Azure VNets over an IPSec or OpenVPN tunnel.

🔹 Point-to-Site (P2S): Connects a single device to Azure.
🔹 Site-to-Site (S2S): Connects an entire on-prem network to Azure.
🔹 ExpressRoute: Dedicated private connection (faster than VPN).

💡 Use S2S VPN for hybrid cloud scenarios.

Q13: Explain the difference between Azure Load Balancer and Azure Application Gateway.
Answer:

Feature	Azure Load Balancer	Azure Application Gateway
Layer	Layer 4 (Transport)	Layer 7 (Application)
Traffic Type	TCP/UDP	HTTP/HTTPS
Features	Distributes VM traffic	URL-based routing, SSL termination
Use Case	Balancing VM workloads	Load balancing web applications
